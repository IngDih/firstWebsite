                    When you start a tech course you will either be fascinated towards the front or back end, based on
                    your own experiences and preferences. It is for sure important do be able to become a full-stack
                    programmer with multiples talents, but it is hard not to fall for web design. <br>
                    <br>This Front End Web Development includes not one or two, but three coding languages: HTML, CSS
                    and JAVASCRIPT. Each one is responsible for one part of the construction of a website: HTML is the
                    overall structure, CSS takes control of the design and JS does some kind of magic, interacting with
                    the user through its functionalities.<br>
                    <br>On their respective pages they will be discussed in more depth but to do a simple
                    exemplification, the following video by Danielle Thé with no more than 4 minutes explains in a easy
                    straight-forward way.

                    A webpage would look and feel incomplete if some of these three elements were not present. Below
                    a table containing their main purposes:
                    <br><br>
                    <!-- some unorganized list -->

                    <br>
                    On the following pages each one of these programming languages will be discussed and examplified.
