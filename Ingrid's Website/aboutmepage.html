                    <p> In this project I thought of using
                        bootstrap or other templates I could find online to make this look more advanced and
                        professional, but decided to make it all by my own, from scratch, utilizing some research mainly
                        from
                        W3Schools, that helped a lot to put things together.</p>
                    <p> The overall concept of this website was to get out of the conventional black, gray and white to
                        make a girly template, with pastel colours, round borders and a neutral white background, that
                        would aim an arts and craft public, and serve as a good template for a bullet
                        journal website. My inspiration was probably the style of template I would liked to have had on
                        my tumblr in 2017, when I was desperate to find something cute and round like those flip
                        cellphones
                        or old typing machines. </p>
                    <p>All the pictures used that were colected from the internet and saved on the img folder were
                        referenced on the "references" text document, as well as the video embed on the index page.</p>
